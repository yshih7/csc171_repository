In the second part of the assignment, the program will take in any name and praise it by saying you rock. Press Q to exit the second program. In the third part, The program uses a series expansion equation to approximate the value of pi. By inputing a certain precision, the program will ran till the approximate value reaches the desired precision and output how many steps it took to reach that precision. In the fourth part, the program will print out the "twelves verses of christmas" using a for loop.
